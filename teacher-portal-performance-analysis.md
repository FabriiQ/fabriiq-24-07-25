# Teacher Portal Performance & Memory Issues Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the main causes of high memory usage, slow page loads, and potential memory leaks in the Teacher Portal. It is based on a scan of the portal's data fetching, component implementation, and offline caching strategies. Solutions are suggested for each issue and will be used for future fixes.

---

## 1. Data Fetching & Large Data Processing

### Issues
- **Unpaginated API Responses**: Endpoints like `getTeacherClasses`, `getAssessmentResults`, and leaderboard APIs may return all records at once, causing high memory usage and slow page loads.
- **Large Table/Grid Rendering**: Leaderboard and analytics components render large datasets without virtualization or lazy loading, increasing memory consumption.
- **Redundant Data Fetching**: Some pages may fetch the same data multiple times due to unoptimized React Query or `useEffect` usage.

### Solutions
- Implement pagination and filtering in all major API endpoints.
- Use virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`) for large tables and grids.
- Audit and optimize data fetching logic to avoid redundant API calls.

## 2. Memory Leak Risks

### Issues
- **Event Listeners/Intervals**: Components using `useEffect` for listeners or intervals may not clean up properly, causing memory leaks.
- **Global State Retention**: Large objects stored in React Context or Redux can persist in memory longer than needed.
- **Offline Cache Growth**: IndexedDB caching for offline support may grow unbounded if not managed.

### Solutions
- Ensure all listeners and intervals are cleaned up in `useEffect` return functions.
- Limit the size and lifetime of objects in global state.
- Implement cache eviction policies for IndexedDB.

## 3. Performance Issues

### Issues
- **No Pagination/Lazy Loading**: Pages like class lists, activities, and leaderboards load all data at once, slowing down rendering and increasing memory usage.
- **Heavy Client-Side Computation**: Sorting and analytics calculations are performed on the client, which can be slow for large datasets.
- **Repeated API Calls**: Inefficient use of hooks can trigger multiple API requests, increasing load and memory usage.

### Solutions
- Paginate and lazy load all large datasets.
- Move heavy computations to the server or use memoization (`useMemo`).
- Audit hooks to prevent repeated API calls.

---

## 4. General Recommendations
- Profile memory usage and performance using Chrome DevTools and Node.js profiling tools.
- Monitor API response times and optimize slow endpoints.
- Test with large datasets to ensure scalability.

## 5. Class Performance Data Table & Caching Analysis

### How It Works
- **Centralized Data Table**: Class performance metrics are precomputed and stored in a dedicated table/model. Dashboards and other pages read from this table, reducing repeated heavy API calls and improving consistency.
- **Caching**: Data is cached both server-side (Redis) and client-side (IndexedDB) for offline access and faster page loads.
- **Offline Support**: When offline, components load cached data from IndexedDB. Sync occurs when the connection is restored.

### Issues & Inconsistencies

#### 1. Stale or Inconsistent Cache
- **TTL Mismatch**: Server-side cache TTL (e.g., Redis) and client-side cache (IndexedDB) may not be synchronized, leading to stale data on one side.
- **No Cache Invalidation**: Updates to class performance (e.g., new grades, attendance) may not trigger cache invalidation, so users see outdated data.
- **Multiple Cache Keys**: Different components use different cache key formats, risking cache misses or duplication.

#### 2. Offline Data Sync Problems
- **Partial Sync**: If sync fails or is interrupted, some offline changes may not be uploaded, causing data loss or inconsistency.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Simultaneous edits online/offline may not be merged correctly, leading to lost updates.
- **No Data Freshness Indicator**: Users may not know if cached data is outdated.

#### 3. Performance Bottlenecks
- **Large Cache Size**: Unbounded IndexedDB growth can slow down reads/writes, especially on low-end devices.
- **Redundant Fetches**: Some components still fetch data from the server even when cached data is available.
- **Virtualization Not Used Everywhere**: Large tables/grids may still render all rows at once, impacting memory and speed.

---

## 6. Recommendations & Solutions

### 1. Cache Consistency
- Standardize cache key formats across all components.
- Implement cache invalidation on all relevant data updates (grades, attendance, etc.).
- Sync TTL between server and client caches.

### 2. Offline Data Improvements
- Add data freshness indicators (e.g., “Last updated: X minutes ago”) to all cached views.
- Implement robust conflict resolution for simultaneous edits.
- Queue all offline changes and retry sync until successful.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Limit IndexedDB cache size and implement eviction policies (e.g., LRU).
- Audit all components to ensure they use cached data when available.
- Use virtualization for all large tables/grids.

### 4. Monitoring & Testing
- Add analytics for cache hit/miss rates and sync success/failure.
- Test with large datasets and poor network conditions.
- Profile cache read/write times and optimize as needed.

## 7. Data Source Audit: Are Pages Using Class Performance Table?

- **Audit Summary**: Some teacher portal pages correctly use the class performance data table for dashboards and analytics, reducing redundant computation and fetches. However, certain pages/components still fetch raw data (e.g., activities, assessments, student lists) and compute metrics client-side, especially when offline or when cache is missing/stale.
- **Direct Fetching/Computing Detected**: Pages such as detailed activity views, assessment grading, and some leaderboard components may bypass the class performance table and fetch raw records, then compute metrics in the browser. This increases memory usage and slows down page loads for large classes.
- **Recommendation**: Refactor all relevant pages to consistently use the class performance table for summary and analytics data. Only fetch raw records when absolutely necessary (e.g., for drill-down or editing workflows).
