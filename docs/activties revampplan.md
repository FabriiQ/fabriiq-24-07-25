# Component-Based Activities Implementation Plan

## System Analysis
The current system uses a monolithic approach to activities, with limited flexibility and few options for interactive content. The revamp will introduce a component-based architecture using Plate.js as the rich text editor foundation.

### Current Limitations
- Limited activity types with fixed structures
- No easy way to create rich, interactive content
- Poor extensibility for new types of learning activities
- Limited analytics on student engagement with content
- Minimal options for varied assessment formats

### Key Requirements
- Support multiple activity types (reading, video, quiz, etc.)
- Enable rich text editing and multimedia content
- Provide interactive elements for student engagement
- Track detailed analytics on student interactions
- Allow easy extension with new activity types
- Support responsive design for mobile learning

## Proposed Enhancements

### Component Architecture
We will implement a registry-based plugin architecture allowing each activity type to register:
- Editor components for content creation
- Viewer components for student consumption
- Schemas defining the data structure
- Analytics handlers for interaction tracking

### Activity Types

1. **Reading Activities**
   - Rich text content with formatting
   - Embedded media (images, diagrams)
   - Section-based organization
   - Reading time estimates

2. **Quiz Activities**
   - Multiple question types (multiple choice, short answer, etc.)
   - Automatic grading capabilities
   - Custom feedback options
   - Randomization and time limits

3. **Video Activities**
   - Support for YouTube, Vimeo, and direct video sources
   - Interactive transcript and notes
   - Time-based interactions and checkpoints
   - Viewing progress tracking

Additional types planned for future phases:
- Discussion activities
- Interactive simulations
- Coding exercises
- Group collaboration activities

### Technical Approach
- Use Plate.js for rich text editing capabilities
- Implement React-based components for different activity types
- Design schema validation using Zod
- Create analytics tracking for all user interactions
- Build responsive UI with accessibility features

## Migration Strategy

### Phase Approach
1. Develop core infrastructure
2. Build activity creation UI and API
3. Implement initial activity types
4. Create student-facing activity viewer
5. Add advanced features and analytics

### Data Migration
- Develop conversion utilities for existing activities
- Provide fallback rendering for legacy content
- Preserve all existing student progress data
- Create admin tools for bulk conversion

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for component rendering and state management
- Integration tests for editor and viewer components
- API tests for activity storage and retrieval
- Schema validation tests for data integrity

### Manual Testing
- User acceptance testing with teachers for creation experience
- Student testing for consumption and interaction
- Accessibility testing across all components
- Cross-browser and responsive design testing

- Analytics dashboard enhancements
- Assessment integrations

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- Created the ActivityTypeRegistry for managing activity types
- Set up the PlateEditor component for rich text editing
- Implemented the Reading Activity type with editor and viewer components
- Created necessary schemas and interfaces for activity content
- Created the activity types directory structure

### Phase 2: Activity Builder UI & API ✅ COMPLETED  

- Created the Activity Builder UI in `src/app/admin/campus/classes/[id]/activities/new/page.tsx`
- Updated the API router in `src/server/api/routers/activity.ts` to support the new activity format
- Updated the activity service in `src/server/api/services/activity.service.ts` to handle component-based activities
- Added analytics tracking to the activity service
- Fixed linter errors in the ActivityBuilder UI

### Phase 3: Additional Activity Types ✅ COMPLETED

- Implemented the Quiz Activity type with multiple question formats:
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Multiple answer questions
  - Short answer questions
  - True/False questions
- Added support for quiz settings like:
  - Passing score requirements
  - Feedback customization
  - Points per question
  - Result display options
- Implemented the Video Activity type with support for:
  - Multiple video sources (YouTube, Vimeo, direct URLs)
  - Custom video player controls
  - Transcript and notes
  - Time tracking and completion requirements
  - Optional post-video submissions
- Ensured all activity types are registered with the activity registry
- Created a centralized export index file for easier imports

### Phase 4: Activity Viewer & Student Experience (Pending)

- Create an activity viewer page that can render any activity type
- Implement the activity progress tracking system
- Add student submission capabilities for interactive activities
- Build mobile-responsive layouts for all activity components

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Analytics (Pending)

- Implement real-time collaboration features
- Add content versioning and revision history
- Enhance analytics dashboard with activity metrics
- Develop recommendation engine based on student performance
- Create assessment and grading integrations
